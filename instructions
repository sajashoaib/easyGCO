To manage a user flow between **Sign In**, **Register**, and **Reset Password** pages, here's a suggested scenario for the flow, along with the logic for each page:

### Scenario Overview:
1. **First Page (Default)**: The **Sign In** page is the default or first page that users will encounter when they access your application.
2. **Register** page: If the user does not have an account, they can navigate to the Register page via a "Sign Up" link/button.
3. **Reset Password** page: If the user forgot their password, they can navigate to the Reset Password page via a "Forgot Password" link/button.
4. **Redirects**: Each page should be able to navigate between the Sign In, Register, and Reset Password pages based on user interaction.

### Scenario Details:
- **Page 1**: **Sign In Page (Default Page)**
    - This is where users who have an account sign in.
    - If the sign-in is successful (valid email and password), the user is redirected to the main application page.
    - If the user doesn't have an account, they can click a "Sign Up" link/button to go to the **Register** page.
    - If the user forgot their password, they can click the "Forgot Password" link/button to go to the **Reset Password** page.
  
- **Page 2**: **Register Page**
    - This page is where new users create an account.
    - The page contains a form that collects user information such as email, password, and any additional registration fields.
    - Once the user registers, they are either redirected to the **Sign In** page or automatically signed in and redirected to the main application page.
    - If the user already has an account, they can click the "Sign In" link/button to go back to the **Sign In** page.
  
- **Page 3**: **Reset Password Page**
    - This page allows users to reset their password by entering their registered email address.
    - After the user submits the email, they are either shown a success message or redirected back to the **Sign In** page.
    - There should also be a "Back to Sign In" link/button to navigate back to the **Sign In** page.

### Flow Logic for Each Page:

1. **Sign In Page Logic**:
    - **Form Fields**: Email, Password, "Sign In" button.
    - **Validation**: Validate email and password on submission (via local storage or API).
    - **Error Handling**: Show errors if credentials are incorrect.
    - **Redirect to Main Application**: If credentials are correct, redirect to the main application page (e.g., `dashboard.html`).
    - **Links/Buttons**:
      - **"Sign Up"**: Redirects to **Register** page.
      - **"Forgot Password"**: Redirects to **Reset Password** page.

    ```javascript
    if (validCredentials) {
      window.location.href = 'dashboard.html'; // Redirect to dashboard after successful login
    } else {
      // Show error message
    }
    ```

2. **Register Page Logic**:
    - **Form Fields**: Email, Password, Confirm Password, "Register" button.
    - **Validation**: Ensure the email is not already registered (check in local storage or API), and passwords match.
    - **Error Handling**: Show errors for invalid inputs (e.g., email format, password length, etc.).
    - **After Registration**:
      - Option 1: Redirect to **Sign In** page after successful registration.
      - Option 2: Automatically sign in the user and redirect to the main application page.
    - **Links/Buttons**:
      - **"Sign In"**: Redirects to the **Sign In** page.

    ```javascript
    if (registrationSuccessful) {
      // Option 1: Redirect to sign in page
      window.location.href = 'signin.html';
      
      // Option 2: Automatically sign in and redirect to dashboard
      window.location.href = 'dashboard.html';
    } else {
      // Show error message
    }
    ```

3. **Reset Password Page Logic**:
    - **Form Fields**: Email, "Reset Password" button.
    - **Validation**: Validate if the email exists in the system (check in local storage or API).
    - **Error Handling**: Show error if the email is not registered.
    - **After Submission**:
      - Show a success message indicating that an email with password reset instructions has been sent (if applicable).
      - Redirect to **Sign In** page after the password reset process (or after a success message).
    - **Links/Buttons**:
      - **"Back to Sign In"**: Redirects to **Sign In** page.

    ```javascript
    if (emailExists) {
      // Show success message
      Swal.fire({
        title: 'Password Reset Email Sent!',
        text: 'Check your email for the reset instructions.',
        icon: 'success',
        confirmButtonText: 'Back to Sign In',
      }).then(() => {
        window.location.href = 'signin.html'; // Redirect to sign in page after reset
      });
    } else {
      // Show error message
    }
    ```

### Navigation Between Pages:
- **Sign In Page**:
  - "Sign Up" button/link → **Register Page**.
  - "Forgot Password" button/link → **Reset Password Page**.
  
- **Register Page**:
  - "Sign In" button/link → **Sign In Page**.

- **Reset Password Page**:
  - "Back to Sign In" button/link → **Sign In Page**.

### Local Storage (Optional):
- **Sign In**: Check if the email and password are stored in local storage or the backend database for validation.
- **Register**: Store the user’s email and password in local storage or database after successful registration.
- **Reset Password**: You can simulate sending a reset password email by checking if the email exists in local storage and showing a success message.
